Introduction :
The health care costs constitute a significant fraction of the U.S. economy. Nearly 20% of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is spent on health care. The health spending in theUS
is the highest among all developed nations in absolute numbers as well as apercentage of
the economy. In this work, we will develop a medical price prediction system using
machine learning algorithms which will aid in steering patients to cost effective providers
and thereby curb health spending. The policymakers can also use the tool to better
understand which providers are relatively expensive and take punitive actions if necessary.
The prediction of the medical price will be done using implementing Random Forest
Regression algorithm in machine learning. Additionally, we plan to include the
experiments on the same data with other machine learning models such as Random Forest
Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Linear Regression and compare results. The
findings from these experiments will also be included.
